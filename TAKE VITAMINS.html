<p>Since the most recent revision of this section, the results from several cohort studies, clinical trials, and meta-analyses on the use of vitamin C in patients with COVID-19 have been published in peer-reviewed journals or have been made available as manuscripts before peer review. However, most of these studies had significant limitations, such as a small sample size or a lack of randomization or blinding. In addition, the study designs had different doses or formulations of vitamin C and different outcome measures, and the study populations included patients with varying concomitant medications and COVID-19 disease severity. The studies summarized in this section have had the greatest impact on the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panelâ€™s (the Panel) recommendations. Results from adequately powered, well-designed, and well-conducted clinical trials are needed to provide further guidance on the role of vitamin C in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.</p>
